# FinalYearProject - Procedural Generation of a Planet with optimisation
Final Year Project. A procedurally generated planet with optimisation. Created in Unity 2021.3.8f1 

- Developed a mesh generation system that uses a cube to sphere mapping to generate a spherical mesh.
- Developed a chunked level of detail system, where the mesh of the planet is split into smaller segments to help reduce polygon count.
- Developed, but not implemented into the final version, threading for noise generation using Unityâ€™s job system, where each chunk needing noise generation to be completed are processed on different threads helping to improve performance.
